\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we evaluate an implementation of a multi-cache-level
  prefetching system under the 3rd Data Prefetching Championship
  framework. Our approach is based on enhancing a baseline prefetcher,
  Signature Path Prefetching (SPP) with a new, perceptron-based scheme
  of prefetch filtering.  The key idea here being that by
  de-constraining/de-throttling the underlying prefetcher we can
  achieve high coverage, while using the perceptron prefetch filter to
  ensure high accuracy.

  Our evaluation on the memory intensive traces of SPEC2017 shows that
  this approach enhances the IPC of the system by XX\% over no
  prefetching for a single-core configuration and by XX\% for a
  four-core configuration.  On the system, the winner of DPC-2
  achieves the resultant speedup of XX\% and XX\% in single-core and
  four-core systems respectively.
