\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we evaluate our implementation of a multi-hierarchy 
cache prefetching system under the Data Prefetching Championship 
framework. Our approach is based around an Enhanced Signature Path 
Prefetching (ESPP) mechanism, which tries to speculate the demand 
access stream for a particular depth ahead of the current access.

Our evaluation on the memory intensive traces of SPEC2017 shows that
this approach enhances the IPC of the system by XX\% over no prefetching
for a single-core configuration and by XX\% for a four-core configuration.
On the system, the winner of DPC-2 achieves the resultant speedup of XX\%
and XX\% in single-core and four-core systems respectively.
