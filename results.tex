\label{Results}

We test our implementation within in the guidelines of the championship, using the
memory intensive simpoints from SPEC 2017 traces. For multi-core we developed 50
random mixes and report the weighted speed normalized to the baseline [cite].

Figure XX shows the single-core speedup obtained by our prefetchers for the traces 
provided, followed by the the geomean speedup. All the results have
been normalized to the baseline of no prefetching. For reference, we've compared
our results with the L2C only BOP~\cite{BOP}, which was the winner of the 2nd DPC.
Figure XX shows the multi-core results for our scheme and for BOP, with traces 
arranged in the increasing order of speed-up obtained.

As can be seen, our three prefetchers combined can give a speedup of XX\% and XX\%
on single-core and multi-core systems respectively. This is XX\% and XX\% above BOP.
