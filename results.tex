\label{Results}
We test our implementation in the guidelines of the championship, using the
memory intensive simpoints from SPEC 2017 traces. Figure~\ref{fig:perf} shows 
the single-core speedup obtained by our approach on the traces provided, 
along with the the geomean speedup. 
For reference, we've compared our results with the L2C only BOP~\cite{BOP}, 
which was the winner of the 2nd DPC. Our prefetchers yield a speedup of 40.4\% 
and XX\% on single-core and multi-core systems respectively. This is 12\% and 
(XX-15.1)\% above BOP.
